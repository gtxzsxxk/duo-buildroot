	  This package is obtained from
	  https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk,
	  from which we download the FreeRTOS ported to Milk-V Duo
	  into the Buildroot. This FreeRTOS will run in the small core
	  and will not do anything because it is simply a template
	  with some basic UART demos. You can realize your own ideas
	  by adding code to

	  output/build/milkv-duo-smallcore-freertos-hash/cvitek/task
	  /comm/src/riscv64/comm_main.c

	  If you say Y, then every time you make Buildroot, it will
	  automatically compile and include the FreeRTOS into the
	  fip.bin, which will then be packed into sdcard.img
