	  This package is obtained from
	  https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk,
	  from which we download the first stage bootloader source and
	  compile it, generating the atf bl2.bin. At the mean time, we
	  will use the fiptool.py in this package to create the binary
	  file fip.bin to pack the opensbi, u-boot and so on.

	  If you are using Buildroot to generate the whole SD card
	  Image or the fip.bin, you must say Y to this package!
